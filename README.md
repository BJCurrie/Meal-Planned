# Meal Planned

#### JavaScript Portfolio Project by Ben Currie


## General Info
Time spent deciding what to have for dinner and creating shopping lists adds up. This time can be significantly reduced through the use of a meal plan. However, many people dislike the repetitivity of a single meal plan.

Meal Planned is a JS script that uses a list of stored recipes to produce a randomised weekly meal plan, along with the required ingredients. Meal Planned enables users to enjoy the time savings of manual meal planning, without the monotonousness.
